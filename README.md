# Web Services Projects

This Readme file will be upgraded as the class go on. The repo will be updated weekly for 14 weeks and will host all of my work within that time frame.

Week 3: I have created a route file called *contacts.js* as well as *formController.js* that handles the display of webpages. A folder called *forms* that hosts the _create_ and _update_ contact.
I've also completed the following requirements: 
- Create a POST route to create a new contact. All fields are required. Return the new contact id in the response body.
- Create a DELETE route to delete a contact. Return an http status code representing the successful completion of the request.
